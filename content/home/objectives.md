Formal Methods provide software engineering with tools and techniques for rigorously reasoning about the correctness of systems. While in recent years formal methods are increasingly being used in industry, university curricula are not adapting at the same pace. Some existing formal methods classes interest and challenge students, whereas others fail to ignite student motivation. We need to find ways to teach formal methods to the next generation, and doing so will require us to adapt our teaching to the 21st century students.
FMTea19 is a combined workshop and tutorial at the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods, FM2019. Its aim is to share experiences of teaching formal methods that have gone well, or that failed in surprising ways, as well as to develop ways to reboot the presence of formal methods in curricula. 

**Tutorial Part of FMTea19**

We are pleased to have **Carroll Morgan** giving an invited talk on his approach to and experiences with teaching formal methods to undergraduate students. **Sir Tony Hoare** will also join us to give a talk on the foundations of teaching computer science for future formal methods scientists. We will run two more tutorial presentations, held by Holger Hermanns and Bas Luttik. Our goal is to discuss various models of existing FM teaching, together with innovative proposals for remaining relevant as educators of Formal Methods in the 21st century. Here is the preliminary tutorial schedule:

     9.00 - 10.00 Carroll Morgan (invited talk) 
    10.00 - 10.45 Tony Hoare (foundations talk)
    10.45 - 11.15 Break
    11.15 - 12.00 Holger Hermanns: Teaching concurrency with pseuCo.com (tutorial) 
    12.00 - 12.45 Bas Luttik: Online Teaching Logic and Set Theory (tutorial)

**Workshop Part of FMTea19**

In the workshop part of the event, we aim to attract papers detailing authorsâ€™ experiences with FM Teaching. We would like to get papers discussing successes and failures of various methods, case studies, tools, etc. As self-learning seems to be an important aspect of FM teaching, we appreciate experiences with online teaching, including experiences with teaching formal methods via Coursera. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest for the FMTea19 workshop is below:
traditional FM teaching: lectures, exercises, exams
online FM teaching/learning: experiences/proposals
teaching FM for industry
integrating/embedding FM teaching/thinking within other computer science courses
student projects on FM, including group projects

Computer science is transforming into a rigorous engineering discipline. Improved teaching techniques will ensure that FM is at the heart of this transformation process.
