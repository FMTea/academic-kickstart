FMTea19 is organised by FMEâ€™s Teaching Committee. Our broad aim is to support a worldwide improvement in learning Formal Methods, mainly by teaching but also via self-learning. To that end, we started to collect a list of FM courses taught worldwide (https://github.com/luigiapetre/Formal-Methods-Courses/issues) and plan to collect other resources as well, such as FM case studies, FM inspirational papers, etc.
