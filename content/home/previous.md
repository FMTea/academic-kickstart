Several events focused on teaching aspects for Formal Methods were held in the beginning of the 2000s: two BCS-FACS TFM workshops (Oxford in 2003 and London in 2006), the TFM 2004 conference in Ghent (with proceedings published as Springer LNCS Volume 3294), the FM-Ed 2006 workshop (Hamilton, co-located with FM'06), FORMED (Budapest, at ETAPS 2008), and FMET 2008 (Kitakyushu 2008, co-located with ICFEM). The latest event was TFM2009, the 2nd International FME Conference on Teaching Formal Methods, in November 2009 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
