FMTea19 invites high quality papers reporting on opinions, approaches, experiences, and empirical studies related to the topic of teaching Formal Methods. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. The proceedings will be published as an LNCS volume, either as part of the FM Satellite Events LNCS proceedings or as a separate LNCS volume. (The exact nature of the proceedings will depend on the number of accepted papers.)

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in llncs2e.zip and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template for your contribution). Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Submissions should be made using the FMTea19 Easychair web site:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmtea19
All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop. Their authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by an early date, to be indicated by the FM2019 organizers, and present the paper.
